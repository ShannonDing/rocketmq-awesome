## How to contribute
Apache RocketMQ is developed by a friendly and open community. Everybody is warmly welcome to join the community and contribute to Apache RocketMQ. 

There are several ways contribute to Apache RocketMQ including file bug reports, joining discussions on the mailing lists, proposing new features,  contributing code or documentation, improving the website, or testing release candidates and so on.


## File a bug report
Please let us know if you experienced a problem with RocketMQ and file a bug report. Open [Github Issue](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/issues) and click on the New issue.

The issue tracker is used for bug reporting purposes **ONLY** whereas feature request needs to follow the [RIP process](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq/wiki/RocketMQ-Improvement-Proposal). To avoid unnecessary duplication, please check whether there is a previous issue before filing a new one.

Please ensure that your bug report is clear and self-contained. Otherwise, it would take additional rounds of communication, thus more time, to understand the problem itself.

As a result, it would be very helpful yet challenging if you could provide an isolated project reproducing your reported issue. Anyway, please ensure your issue report is informative enough for the community to pick up. At a minimum, include the following hints:

### BUG REPORT

1. Please describe the issue you observed:

    - What did you do (The steps to reproduce)?

    - What is expected to see?

    - What did you see instead?

2. Please tell us about your environment:

3. Other information (e.g. detailed explanation, logs, related issues, suggestions on how to fix, etc):

### FEATURE REQUEST

1. Please describe the feature you are requesting.

2. Provide any additional detail on your proposed use case for this feature.

2. Indicate the importance of this issue to you (blocker, must-have, should-have, nice-to-have). Are you currently using any workarounds to address this issue?

4. If there are some sub-tasks involved, use -[] for each sub-task and create a corresponding issue to map to the sub-task:

   - [sub-task1-issue-number](example_sub_issue1_link_here): sub-task1 description here, 
   - [sub-task2-issue-number](example_sub_issue2_link_here): sub-task2 description here,
